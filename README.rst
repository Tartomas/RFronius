# RFronius

An R client library for the Fronius API

First we need to install :code:`httr`. for HTTP requests.

.. code-block:: R

  install.packages('httr')

Then download the "apisolarweb.R" script in this branch and run it. This set up a series of function access to the Fronius API. 

.. code-block:: R

  source('apisolarweb.R')
